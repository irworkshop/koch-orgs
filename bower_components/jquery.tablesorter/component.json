  "readme": "tablesorter is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.\ntablesorter can successfully parse and sort many types of data including linked data in a cell.\n\n### [Documentation](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/)\n\n* See the [full documentation](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/).\n* All of the [original document pages](http://tablesorter.com/docs/) have been included.\n* Information from my blog post on [undocumented options](http://wowmotty.blogspot.com/2011/06/jquery-tablesorter-missing-docs.html) and lots of new demos have also been included.\n* Change log moved from included text file into the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki/Change).\n\n### Demos\n\n* [Basic alpha-numeric sort Demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/).\n* Links to demo pages can be found within the main [documentation](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/).\n* More demos & playgrounds - updated in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki).\n\n### Features\n\n* Multi-column alphanumeric sorting.\n* Multi-tbody sorting - see the [options](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/index.html#options) table on the main document page.\n* Parsers for sorting text, alphanumeric text, URIs, integers, currency, floats, IP addresses, dates (ISO, long and short formats) &amp; time. [Add your own easily](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers.html).\n* Support for ROWSPAN and COLSPAN on TH elements.\n* Support secondary \"hidden\" sorting (e.g., maintain alphabetical sort when sorting on other criteria).\n* Extensibility via [widget system](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widgets.html).\n* Cross-browser: IE 6.0+, FF 2+, Safari 2.0+, Opera 9.0+.\n* Small code size.\n* Works with jQuery 1.2.6+ (jQuery 1.4.1+ needed with some widgets).\n* Works with jQuery 1.9+ ($.browser.msie was removed; needed in the original version).\n\n### Licensing\n\n* Copyright (c) 2007 Christian Bach.\n* Original examples and docs at: [http://tablesorter.com](http://tablesorter.com).\n* Dual licensed under the [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licenses.\n\n### Special Thanks\n\n* Big shout-out to [Nick Craver](https://github.com/NickCraver) for getting rid of the `eval()` function that was previously needed for multi-column sorting.\n* Also big thanks to [thezoggy](https://github.com/thezoggy) for helping with code, themes and providing valuable feedback.\n* And, thanks to everyone else that has contributed, and continues to contribute to this forked project!\n\n### Change Log\n\nView the [complete listing here](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki/Change).\n\n#### Version 2.8.2 (3/28/2013)\n\n* Updated the \"ignore-leads\" parser:\n  * Renamed the parser to \"ignore-articles\"\n  * Added language support and a few languages\n  * Added a method to add custom articles.\n  * Please see the [updated demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-ignore-articles.html) (also renamed)\n  * Thanks for [thezoggy](https://github.com/thezoggy) for feedback.\n* Fixed a bug in the grouping widget demo:\n  * The \"priority (letter)\" column was incorrectly parsing the data which, for some reason, worked in some browsers.\n  * Thanks again to [thezoggy](https://github.com/thezoggy) for reporting [this issue](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/267).\n\n#### Version 2.8.1 (3/27/2013)\n\n* Added `customAjaxUrl` option to the pager:\n  * This function is called after all processing has been applied to the `ajaxUrl` string.\n  * Use this function to make any other string modifications, as desired.\n  * Thanks to [Cthulhu59](https://github.com/Cthulhu59) for contributing. See [pull request #256](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/256).\n\n#### Version 2.8 (3/27/2013)\n\n* Added an `updateAll` method\n  * This method allows you to update the cache with data from both the `thead` and `tbody` of the table.\n  * The `update` method only updates the cache from the `tbody`.\n  * This fixes [issue #262](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/262).\n\n* Added a grouping rows widget:\n  * It only works in tablesorter 2.8+ and jQuery v1.7+.\n  * This widget was added to a subfolder named `widgets` within the `js` directory.\n  * A group header is added, after sorting a column, which groups rows that match the selector.\n  * Selectors include whole words, letters, numbers and dates (year, month, day, weekday and time).\n  * Check out [the demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-grouping.html) and get more details on how to use the widget there.\n  * Thanks to [Brian Ghidinelli](http://www.ghidinelli.com/) for sharing his custom widget code.\n\n* Added multiple parsers\n  * [Month](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-dates.html)\n  * [Two digit year](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-dates.html) (mmddyy, ddmmyy and yymmdd)\n  * [Weekday](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-dates.html)\n  * [Date library](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-dates.html) (sugar &amp; datejs)\n  * ISO 8601 date by [Sean Ellingham](https://github.com/seanellingham) (no demo, yet)\n  * [Metric prefixes](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-metric.html)\n  * [Ignore leads](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-ignore-articles.html) parser (ignores \"A\", \"An\" and \"The\" in titles)\n  * [Inputs, checkbox and select parsers](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-grouping.html). These parsers automatically update on element changes, but requires jQuery 1.7+.\n\n* Tablesorter's \"update\" method now checks if a column sort has been enabled or disabled:\n  * Please note that the sorter precendence (order of priority) is still inforced ([reference](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-options-headers.html)).\n  * So, for example, if you add a \"sorter-false\" class name to the header, it will disable the column sort if **no** jQuery data, metadata, headers option or other `\"sorter-{some parser}\" class name is already in place.\n  * To make sure a column becomes disabled, set it's jQuery data, then update:\n\n    ```javascript\n    $('th:eq(0)').data('sorter', false);\n    $('table').trigger('update');\n    ```\n\n  * Thanks to dibs76 for asking about this on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15222170/jquery-tablesorter-addclasssorter-false-not-disabling-sort).\n  * This is also related to [issue #262](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/262).\n\n* Custom parsers detection now has higher priority over default parsers:\n  * If your custom parser just has an `is()` check that only returns false, nothing will change. You can still set the parser using jQuery data, metadata, the `headers` option or header class name as usual (in this [order of priority](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-parsers-class-name.html)).\n  * What this means is that if you wrote a custom parser with an `is()` check (which tests the string and returns a boolean where `true` shows a match for your parser), it would have previously been checked after all of the default parsers were checked.\n  * Now the automatic parser detection works in reverse, from newest (custom parsers) to oldest (default parsers). So the default text and digit parsers will always be checked last.\n\n* The `addWidget` method will now extend an included `options` object into the widget options (`table.config.widgetOptions`).\n  * Default widgets will not use this functionality until version 3.0, to keep them backwards compatible.\n  * Include any widget options, when writing a new widget, as follows:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // *******************\n    // parameters:\n    // table = table object (DOM)\n    // c = config object (from table.config)\n    // wo = all widget options (from table.config.widgetOptions)\n    $.tablesorter.addWidget({\n      id: 'myWidget',\n      // widget options (added v2.8) - added to table.config.widgetOptions\n      options: {\n        myWidget_option1 : 'setting1',\n        myWidget_option2 : 'setting2'\n      },\n      // The init function (added v2.0.28) is called only after tablesorter has\n      // initialized, but before initial sort & before any of the widgets are applied.\n      init: function(table, thisWidget, c, wo){\n        // widget initialization code - this is only *RUN ONCE*\n        // but in this example, only the format function is called to from here\n        // to keep the widget backwards compatible with the original tablesorter\n        thisWidget.format(table, config, widgetOptions, true);\n      },\n      format: function(table, c, wo, initFlag) {\n        // widget code to apply to the table *AFTER EACH SORT*\n        // the initFlag is true when this format is called from the init\n        // function above otherwise initFlag is undefined\n        // * see the saveSort widget for a full example *\n        // access the widget options as follows:\n        if (wo.myWidget_option1 === 'setting1') {\n          alert('YAY');\n        }\n      },\n      remove: function(table, c, wo){\n        // do what ever needs to be done to remove stuff added by your widget\n        // unbind events, restore hidden content, etc.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n  * Updated the demo showing how you can write your own widget\n\n* Updated all methods to stop event propagation past the table. This prevents sorted inner tables from also sorting the outer table. Fixes [issue #263](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/263).\n* Updated filter widget to restore previous search after an update. Fixes [issue #253](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/253).\n* Updated bower manifest file, thanks to [joyvuu-dave](https://github.com/joyvuu-dave) for the [pull request #252](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/252).\n* Updated several public methods that require a table element:\n  * These methods will now accept either a <em>table DOM element</em> or a <em>jQuery object</em>; previously it would only accept a DOM element.\n  * Modified these `$.tablesorter` functions: `isProcessing`, `clearTableBody`, `destroy`, `applyWidget` and `refreshWidgets`.\n  * Example: `$.tablesorter.destroy( document.getElementById('myTable') );` or `$.tablesorter.destroy( $('#myTable') );`\n  * See [issue #243](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/243).\n* Updated Bootstrap from version 2.1.1 to 2.3.1.\n* Fixed issue with bootstrap demo not working in IE7. It was a silly trailing comma. Fixes [issue #265](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/265).\n* Fixed the filter widget to work properly across tbodies. It now leaves non-sortable tbodies intact. Fixes [issue #264](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/264).\n* Fixed the `updateCell` method which would cause a javascript error when spammed. It would try to resort the table while the tbody was detached.\n* Fixed `shortDate` parser so that it no longer detects semantic version numbers (e.g. \"1.0.0\").\n* Fixed the internal `getData()` function to properly get dashed class names; e.g. `\"sorter-my-custom-parser\"` will look for a parser with an id of `\"my-custom-parser\"`.\n* Fixed IE code examples all appearing in line.\n* Did some general code cleanup and rearranging.\n\n#### Version 2.7.12 (3/1/2013)\n\n* Fixed hiding filter rows when using filter_formatter elements. See [issue #250](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/250).\n* Fixed an issue with `updateCell` method not removing extra table rows before computing the row index of the cell that was just updated.\n* Added an `exactMatch` option to the html5color filter_formatter function.\n* Added missing documentation for the `updateCell` callback method. It's been there for a while!\n\n#### Version 2.7.11 (2/24/2013)\n\n* Fixed several javascript errors:\n  * Empty cells in a numeric column should no longer cause an error - fixes [issue #246](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/246).\n  * The tablesorter storage function should no longer cause an error when provided an undefined key - fixes [issue #244](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/244).\n* Added `saveSortReset` method to clear any saved sorts for a specific table. Use it as follows:\n\n    ```javascript\n    $('table').trigger('saveSortReset');\n    ```\n\n* Added `delayed` options to several filter formatter functions.\n  * Selectors that can be changed quickly - uiSlider, uiRange, uiSpinner, html5Range and html5Number - will now execute the filter query after a short delay.\n  * The filter delay time is set in the filter function option `filter_searchDelay`. The default delay is 300 milliseconds.\n\n#### Version 2.7.10 (2/22/2013)\n\n* Updated widget storage function to ensure no invalid strings are passed to the `$.parseJSON` function.\n  * Thanks to [andriijas](https://github.com/andriijas) for the code suggestion :)\n  * Fixes [issue #240](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/240) &amp; [issue #244](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/244).\n* Updated filter widget:\n  * When cell content contains quotes and the filter select is added, the quotes are now properly processed to be included within the options. Fixes [issue #242](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/242).\n  * Empty cells are no longer added to the options. If you want to include empty cells, add the following (see [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/14990971/145346)):\n\n    ```html\n    <span style=\"display:none\">{empty}</span>\n    ```\n\n    Then you'll get a select dropdown showing `{empty}` allowing you to select empty content.\n\n#### Version 2.7.9 (2/20/2013)\n\n* Fixed an issue with the pager targetting an incorrect page when the table starts out empty.\n* Get the correct number of columns when `widthFixed` is `true` and the first row contains a table. See [issue #238](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/238).\n",
